# SpeakerQueue

Real time music player.  Create a room and add tracks or jam in the party room.  Still a work in progress...
## Getting started
<section>
  <span>Make sure you have the following installed first:</span>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

Then Clone the repo by running the following command in the command prompt
```
git clone https://github.com/rcasto/SpeakerQueue/ <path-to-store>
```
<bold>Note:</bold> You can leave the path in the command out if you just want the repo in the current directory
<br/><br/>
Navigate to the SpeakerQueue repo directory and then run to the following command:
```
npm install
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies for SpeakerQueue to run
```
npm start
```
This will start the SpeakerQueue instance running locally, by default at <a href="http://localhost:3000/" target="_blank">localhost:3000</a>
